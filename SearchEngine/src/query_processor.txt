1-get the query from the http request
2-process the query (same processing of our stored data in DB)
3-search the given strin gfor each query in the database to retrieve their inverted file
4-Rank the pages occourding to the used algorithm  (TF-IDF) for now
5-search the given indicies in the DB to retrieve the urls
6-Send the resulted urls after sorting to te dynamic page to view them


TF= (No. of occourance of word in each type/total words in doc)*(10/periority)   tf(data)=(3/1000)*(10/10) ->head  + (100/1000)*(10/2) + ....
TF << is better than large tfs

IDF=(5000/N doc containing word)

doc1=tf1*idf1 +tf2*idf2 +.....

docn


sort them descending greater value means better result
