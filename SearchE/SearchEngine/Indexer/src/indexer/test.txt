The
Arduino
UNO
Rev.3
board
is
a
microcontroller
board
based
on
the
ATmega328
(data
sheet).
It
has
14
digital
input/output
pins
(of
which
6
can
be
used
as
PWM
outputs),
6
analog
inputs,
a
16
MHz
crystal
oscillator,
a
USB
connection,
a
power
jack,
an
ICSP
header,
and
a
reset
button.
It
contains
everything
needed
to
support
the
microcontroller;
simply
connect
it
to
a
computer
with
a
USB
cable
or
power
it
with
a
AC-to-DC
adapter
or
battery
to
get
started.
